# Redux

#### _Implement Redux from scratch for fun and for profit_

Redux is a global state management library! [Read more about redux here](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started).

Passing state around can get out of hand!
Generally keeping the data as close to where it is needed is good.

```javacsript
const Header = ({ users }) => <div>
  There are {users.length} users on the site!
</div>;

const User => ({ name }) => <div>{name}</div>;

const UserList = ({ users }) => <div>
  {users.map((user, i) => <User user={user} key={i} />)}
</div>;

class App extends React.Component {
  state = { users: [] };

  componentWillMount() {
    fetchUsers().then((users) => this.setState({ users }));
  }

  render() {
	const { users } = this.state;
	return (<div>
	  <Header users={users} />
	  <UserList users={users} />
	</div>);
  }
}
```

Enter Redux!

- State

```javascript
{
  counter: 0;
}
```

- Actions

```javascript
{ type: string, data: object }
```

- Action Creators

```
const incrementAction = (count) => ({ type: 'increment', count });
```

- Actions mutate state with Reducers

```
const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) =>
  action.type === 'increment' ? state + 1 : state;
```

## Motivation

If say you understand something you should be able to explain it to somebody.
How about explaining it to a computer?

There's actually not much going on here:

```bash
nick:~/dev/_learning/redux master > wc -l *.mjs src/*
      61 test.mjs
       9 src/applyMiddlewares.mjs
       9 src/combineReducers.mjs
      13 src/index.mjs
      36 src/store.mjs
       9 src/thunk.mjs
     137 total
```

Coding things is a great way to demystify them!

## Redux Spec

At each step it's helpful to make a test file that runs your implementation!

Here's the order we reccomend implementing Redux in:

### 1. the Store class

Most of redux's functionality is baked into this class! Everything else is
a helper function built around this class.

```javascript
class Store
  constructor(rootReducer, initialState = {})
  getState(): state
  subscribe(listener): (unsubscribe: Function)
  replaceReducer(nextReducer): void
  dispatch(action): void
```

Redux allows you to listen to state changes with listeners. Subscribe adds a callback function (and returns a function to unsubscribe that listener).

Dispatch calls the rootReducer on the current state, updates the state to be the
result of that pure function and then calls all the listeners.

### 2. combineReducers

Each reducer only recieves a slice of the state (its name!)

```javascript
const combineReducers = (reducers) => (state, action) => nextState;
```

E.g.

```javascript
const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) =>
  action.type === 'increment' ? state + 1 : state;

combineReducers({ counter: countReducer });
```

### 3. createStore

This method should be pretty trivial so far!

```javascript
const createStore = (reducer, preloadedState = {}, enhancer = null) => instanceof Store;
```

But wait... what's an enhancer?

### 4. applyMiddlewares

We need to extend createStore to allow the enhancer function. But what's an
enhancer? It's just a middleware!

OK, great, but like what's a middleware? It's a function that enhances dispatch (similar to how
combineReducers takes a bunch of reducers and makes them act as one).

A middleware has the following signature:

```javascript
const middleware = (store) => (next) => (action) => {};
```

When a middleware calls next, then the next middleware in the chain gets called.

This function has a weird signature!!!!!! Took us a while to finally get
this one right (without cheating!)

This is where 80% of our time was spent implmenenting redux!

```javascript
const applyMiddlewares = (middlewares) => (store) => (next) => (action) => {};
```

### 5. Bonus! redux-thunk

It turns out redux thunk is just a middleware! Redux thunk is used to dispatch beefed up actions that look like actions but have a lot more functionality baked in (for example: api calls, async functions, or dispatching multiple actions).

Implement a middleware that would allow you to write actions that look like
this:

(keep in mind your store should still support plain object actions)

```javascript
const thunkAction = () => (dispatch, getState) => {
  dispatch({ type: 'increment' });
  dispatch({ type: 'increment' });
  // simulate an api call:
  setTimeout(() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' }), 400);
};
```
